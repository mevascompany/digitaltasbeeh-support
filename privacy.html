  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> August 8, 2025</p>
  <p>Welcome to the Privacy Policy of Meva Company's mobile application "Digital Tasbeeh Counter".

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <li>IP address</li>
    <li>App usage duration and frequency</li>

  </ul>
  <p>This data is collected in an anonymized form and may be processed by trusted third-party service providers for analytics and debugging.</p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>The data collected is used to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Google Analytics (for usage statistics)</li>

  </ul>
  <p>These third parties are obligated to use the data solely to support app functionality and performance.</p>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
  <p>While the app itself does not use cookies, some third-party SDKs (Software Development Kits) may use cookies or similar tracking methods to collect anonymous data. You can manage tracking settings from your device settings.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard security measures to protect your data. However, no digital system is completely immune to risks, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data only for as long as needed to provide the service or comply with legal obligations. Any user-generated data is stored locally on your device and is removed when you delete the app or the data manually.</p>
